        <div class="project-box">
          <p>
            Part ghost story, part meditation on self-sacrifice, <em>Desperate Living Creatures</em> is a tautly plotted character
            study that considers those moments in which we commit ourselves to the aid of others,
            and those when, should the cost prove too high, we look away.

            They all wonder what brought Addy Pruitt, the darling of Dustwick, Missouri, to 147th
            Street. Particularly now, when the city’s smog level enshrouds the peaks of its buildings,
            when climate refugees have erected camps in its parks and subways, and when police
            watchtowers monitor its citizens’ movements from every street corner. They wonder the
            same thing about themselves, a group of thirty-something performers making small
            livings instead of art and gathering in bars and apartments to distract each other from
            their inhibited progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there’s something different about Addy. She’s not here to pursue a career as a
            singer or a filmmaker, and she quickly strays from the sidelines on which the performers
            stand—she walks up to police towers to ask why they shine lights in people’s windows;
            she visits tent cities to talk to refugees; even as her pregnancy is becoming more
            apparent—and where is the father?—she organizes protests that end in teargas and
            arrest. Who is this person, they ask themselves.

            Julian thinks he knows. Suffering from a degenerative disease and haunted by the ghost
            of his troubled and often violent brother, who may or may not be dead, Julian observes
            Addy from his window across the courtyard. He is certain that, like him, she is running
            from something dark. And when her past follows her to the city, and the performers are
            too distracted to notice, it is Julian’s consequential action, or inaction, that will determine
            Addy’s fate.

        <h3 class="topic">These Imaginary Acts: a Novel</h3>
        <div class="project-box">
          <p>This is the story of Raymond Meeks, who projects OMNIMAX movies at the Cincinnati
            Museum for twelve dollars an hour. He watches the film spool and unspool and wonders
            what went wrong. Why after ten years of traveling the country and making movies is he
            living once again in the forgotten factory town of his youth? Why, at thirty, is he renting a
            bedroom from his best friend, whose wife wants nothing more than for Meeks to
            disappear? Why couldn’t his life resemble the heroic subject of the museum’s latest film,
            Major A.B. Rogers?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also the story of Major A.B. Rogers, the eccentric nineteenth-century surveyor
            who discovers a deadly mountain pass in the Canadian Rockies. His nephew, Albert,
            has always idolized his uncle, but when he accompanies the scrawny but intimidating
            pathfinder on his latest adventure, young Albert learns just what—and whom—his uncle
            is willing to sacrifice to set his name upon the ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Projecting this film, day after day, Meeks decides that greatness does not have to
            contain itself in the postcard frames of history. So what if Kelly Sutphin, his oldest friend,
            is no longer the boy Meeks once adored? So what if Kelly gave up his dreams of being
            an Olympic diver to manage the pharmacy of a noisy supermarket chain, argue with his
            wife, Dee, and blow off steam at a gun range? Mountains can still be conquered. Tracks
            can still be laid. And if Kelly has lost sight of his own ambitions, maybe it’s time for
            Raymond Meeks to take his place, in whatever way he can.
