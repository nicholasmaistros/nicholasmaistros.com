        <div class="project-box">
          <p>
            A literary ghost story, <em>Desperate Living Creatures</em> explores the tension between self-sacrifice and
            self-preservation. With elements of Andrew Holleran, Shirley Jackson, Don Carpenter, and Tony Kushner, it’s
            a novel that asks us to consider the moments we come to the aid of others, and when, should the costs prove
            too high, we look away.

            Julian is hiding. From the degenerative illness that progressively claims his body. From the people of his
            hometown who’d pegged him and his brother, Mac, as pariahs. From the crimes he and his brother committed
            together after they’d abandoned their mother in that small Colorado town. And eventually, from Mac himself,
            who may or may not be dead, and whose ghost now haunts him in his New York City apartment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though he distracts himself with a fame-hungry group of comedians and opera singers, and though he tries to
            open up to his roommate and sometimes lover, Devon, it isn’t until Addy Pruitt, the darling of Dustwick,
            Missouri, takes the room across the courtyard-alley from his window that he finds someone who might
            understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Addy is hiding as well, Julian is sure of it. As their friendship grows, as he gleans more of Addy’s own
            troubling past, the city around them is having nightmares. Police watchtowers monitor citizens from every
            street corner. Smog enshrouds the peaks of its buildings. Climate refugees erect camps in its parks and
            subways. And when Addy’s past follows her to this choking city, it is Julian’s consequential action, or
            inaction, that will determine their fate.

        <h3 class="topic">These Imaginary Acts: a Novel</h3>
        <div class="project-box">
          <p>This is the story of Raymond Meeks, who projects OMNIMAX movies at the Cincinnati
            Museum for twelve dollars an hour. He watches the film spool and unspool and wonders
            what went wrong. Why after ten years of traveling the country and making movies is he
            living once again in the forgotten factory town of his youth? Why, at thirty, is he renting a
            bedroom from his best friend, whose wife wants nothing more than for Meeks to
            disappear? Why couldn’t his life resemble the heroic subject of the museum’s latest film,
            Major A.B. Rogers?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also the story of Major A.B. Rogers, the eccentric nineteenth-century surveyor
            who discovers a deadly mountain pass in the Canadian Rockies. His nephew, Albert,
            has always idolized his uncle, but when he accompanies the scrawny but intimidating
            pathfinder on his latest adventure, young Albert learns just what—and whom—his uncle
            is willing to sacrifice to set his name upon the ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Projecting this film, day after day, Meeks decides that greatness does not have to
            contain itself in the postcard frames of history. So what if Kelly Sutphin, his oldest friend,
            is no longer the boy Meeks once adored? So what if Kelly gave up his dreams of being
            an Olympic diver to manage the pharmacy of a noisy supermarket chain, argue with his
            wife, Dee, and blow off steam at a gun range? Mountains can still be conquered. Tracks
            can still be laid. And if Kelly has lost sight of his own ambitions, maybe it’s time for
            Raymond Meeks to take his place, in whatever way he can.
