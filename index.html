        <div class="project-box">
          <p>
            With the observational acuity of Andrew Holleran and the menacing psychology of Ottessa Moshfegh, <em>Desperate Living Creatures</em> is the story of two social misfits who meet in troubled times, in a troubled city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Julian surrounds himself with performers—comedians, cartoonists, and opera singers in their early thirties who gather in Harlem apartments to convince themselves of their potential. Distracted by their dramas and day jobs, they don’t notice the police watchtowers monitoring them from every street corner. They wear masks, if they remember, to protect themselves from the smog that enshrouds the city. Without looking, they pass taxicab strikes and the camps of climate refugees on their daily commutes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            They don’t inquire too deeply about Julian’s degenerative illness, which slowly claims his body. They don’t ask where he’s from or why he’s hiding, and they don’t seem to notice Julian’s brother, who may or may not be dead, and whose ghost won’t stop reminiscing about the glorious crimes they committed together.
          </p>
          <p>
            It isn’t until Addy Pruitt, the darling of Dustwick, Missouri, takes the room across the alley that Julian finds someone who might understand. She is hiding too, Julian is sure of it, and when her past follows her to this choking city, it is Julian’s consequential action, or inaction, that will determine her fate.

        <!-- <h3 class="topic">These Imaginary Acts: a Novel</h3>
        <div class="project-box">
          <p>This is the story of Raymond Meeks, who projects OMNIMAX movies at the Cincinnati
            Museum for twelve dollars an hour. He watches the film spool and unspool and wonders
            what went wrong. Why after ten years of traveling the country and making movies is he
            living once again in the forgotten factory town of his youth? Why, at thirty, is he renting a
            bedroom from his best friend, whose wife wants nothing more than for Meeks to
            disappear? Why couldn’t his life resemble the heroic subject of the museum’s latest film,
            Major A.B. Rogers?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also the story of Major A.B. Rogers, the eccentric nineteenth-century surveyor
            who discovers a deadly mountain pass in the Canadian Rockies. His nephew, Albert,
            has always idolized his uncle, but when he accompanies the scrawny but intimidating
            pathfinder on his latest adventure, young Albert learns just what—and whom—his uncle
            is willing to sacrifice to set his name upon the ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Projecting this film, day after day, Meeks decides that greatness does not have to
            contain itself in the postcard frames of history. So what if Kelly Sutphin, his oldest friend,
            is no longer the boy Meeks once adored? So what if Kelly gave up his dreams of being
            an Olympic diver to manage the pharmacy of a noisy supermarket chain, argue with his
            wife, Dee, and blow off steam at a gun range? Mountains can still be conquered. Tracks
            can still be laid. And if Kelly has lost sight of his own ambitions, maybe it’s time for
            Raymond Meeks to take his place, in whatever way he can.
